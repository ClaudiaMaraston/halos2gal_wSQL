# From haloes to model galaxies: using SQL queries and python 

Hands-on lectures making use the Millennium DataBase (http://virgo.dur.ac.uk) to retrive data using SQL queries and analyse the data using python. If time permits we will also look into populating dark matter haloes using halotools. The idea is that those participating will try out queries and scripts and will attempt answering the questions pose, thus, make sure you have a laptop with python or that you make small teams of 2 or 3 with one laptop with python.

On Monday morning, I'll send some more specific details on how to access the initial code through github and the order in which we cover the material. You can refresh what you learnt about github and python during Coleman lectures (https://github.com/CKrawczyk/jupyter_data_languages).
