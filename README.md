Special Course: Galaxy Formation and Evolution

	1st class (29/09):
T: Introduction to galaxy formation (evolution of large scale structures, galaxy properties).
H: Introduction to Python and SQL (Structured Query Language): obtaining the mass function of dark matter haloes with Python from the Millennium DataBase (http://virgo.dur.ac.uk). Generate from there a galaxy stellar mass function making the least assumptions.

2nd class (30/09):
T: Introduction to different techniques for modelling galaxies: Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD), Subhalo Matching (SHAM), Semi-Analytic Models (SAM), hydrodynamical simulations. Advantages of different techniques depending on the application.
H: Use of SQL to get luminosity functions (LF) and galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) of galaxies. Discussion of results.
