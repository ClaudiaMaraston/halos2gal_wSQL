    "We are going to extract data from the [Virgo Database](http://virgo.dur.ac.uk/data.php), in particular from the [millimil](http://galaxy-catalogue.dur.ac.uk:8080/Millennium/) for which is not necessary to register. The millimil has been run in a cubic box of comovin side of $62.5 Mpc/h$ with dark matter particles with a minnimum mass of $0.86*10^9 M_sun/h$. The assumed cosmological parameters in this simulation are: $\\Omega_0 = 0.25$, $\\Lambda _0 = 0.75$, $\\Omega _b = 0.045$ and $h_0 = 0.73$, as for the [Millennium Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0504097).\n",

    "The information in Databases is sorted in tables. The data from a given table can be retrived using SQL. A good tutorial on SQL can be found [here](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-sql). The Virgo Database has a SQL query form, where queries can be directly typed:\n",
